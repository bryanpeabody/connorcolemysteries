Bryan Peabody is the author of the Connor Cole Mystery Series. He's also a software engineer, traveler, photographer and student pilot. 

<img src="/images/me_web.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 15px">While he has many passions, his passion for the Caribbean and South America tops the list. He loves exploring new islands in the Caribbean, visiting old, beautiful cities in South America and ancient historical sites in those regions. 

Bryan has taken the old advice of "write about what you know and what you're passionate about" to heart. His Connor Cole Mystery series draws from his life experiences, professional background and his many travel adventures throughout the Caribbean and South America. 

Bryan currently lives in the southeastern US with his wife. He spends much of his time thinking about his next travel adventures and places and plots that can be used in the next Connor Cole story.
