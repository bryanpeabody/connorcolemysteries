A fun getaway weekend to Key West turns serious when Private Investigator Connor Cole is recognized by a woman in Sloppy Joe's Bar and is asked to help find her missing boyfriend.

When Connor investigates the disappearance, he learns that the missing boyfriend is a treasure hunter that has been searching for a three-hundred-year-old shipwreck in the Florida Straits and the treasure that sunk along with it.

Can Connor find the missing treasure hunter alive, solve the mystery of a long-lost treasure along the way and survive the earth-shattering surprises that the investigation reveals?
