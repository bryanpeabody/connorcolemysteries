Connor Cole spent years running his company in corporate America before everything came crashing down. After moving to Miami to escape his old life, Connor starts working as a private investigator and taking the occasional consulting gig for the FBI with his on again, off again, girlfriend Sofia.

When FBI Special Agent Matthew Banks tells Connor that he would like him to look into a break-in at his friends' company in downtown Miami, Connor gets much more than he bargained for including a dead body and accused of murder. 

Will Connor be able to figure out who is behind it and why, before it's too late?
