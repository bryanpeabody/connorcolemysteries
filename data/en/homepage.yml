      content : "It is a wonderful debut and a great first book in what promises to be a fun series. I certainly will be on the lookout for more books from this author. Connor Cole is well defined and both likeable and believable. Other characters are well described and interesting, .especially his partner and girlfriend, Sophia. The writing is crisp and literate. The plot is well-paced, suspenseful and believable. All in all, the only thing that I didn’t like about the book is that it ended too quickly!"

      content : "When I started reading it I couldn't put it down! Page after page, wanting to know what happened to Simon and who killed him. Chapter after chapter the story grabs you and you really can't put the book down until you find out what happened. Conner Cole is a great protagonist, his personality leaps off the page and his charisma will make you instantly love him from the start. Murder in Magic city is a must book for this year. The characters are amazingly written and the story is a pager turner, that is the best combination afterall."

      content : "If you like fast paced action mysteries, this is the book you need to read! After a brief introduction to the main characters and plot, the book takes off on a whodunnit that will keep you flipping pages until the very end. A fun, light read that is perfect when you want an ecapse to paradise, in this case Miami and South Beach. I didn't see the ending coming, the author did a great job keeping me guessing right until the very end. This was one was my favorite books of the year."
